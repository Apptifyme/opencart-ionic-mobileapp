This is a first version 1.0 of the App. The App will be constantly improved and enhanced for itâ€™s better performance. In order to modify the app you need to have knowledge in web technologies such as JavaScript, html5 and css3. You also need to be able to install Ionic and its dependencies on your machine. 

#### We recommend you to use the Ionic official installation guide.
